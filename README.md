### Next Steps
- At the top of the head of each html page, there will be 2 meta tags, one is "keywords", the other is "description", put information into each of those tags to improve your SEO and what populates when you share links from your site. 
- Be sure to edit/add appropriate alternative text on all image tags.
- All the stock photos I used are free from royalty etc, though they're probably not a good long term solution. 
- Logos of multiple file types and color combinations are in the brand folder. Logos used on the site are also in the assets folder.
- The form fields all have names for hooking up to an API or back end with relative ease.
